Women have to face numerous health issues. Addressing the gender, class or ethnic disparities that exist in healthcare can improve the healthcare field. 

In present times, there are numerous applications that provide the best facilities and contribute to healthcare. But to a surprise, there is no such one stop platform that talks specifically about female healthcare and supports them during their treatment. 

Keeping in mind the seriousness of female healthcare, we have built a solution that acts as a support during their treatment. From basic awareness, to virtual workouts and anonymous chat rooms, we have tried to target both the physical and mental health of the female patient. 

In the application, the user, while signing up, has to fill in basic details about themselves which are stored securely. The user will be having access to several useful features. 

There are several illnesses in which some specific workouts play a vital role in improvement. Keeping in mind the same, we will be providing virtual live training to the user using a demo model and posture detection.
